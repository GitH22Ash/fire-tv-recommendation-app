The inexperience of youth, loneliness, and impulsiveness prevent him from using reason and cool consideration to face the obstacles in his way, and he even sometimes provokes those who stand by him. And thus he finds himself in a situation for which there is only one solution.",1.213,/7ReuhQ5HzkMvIfsTYEgsb9s9EYV.jpg,Drama,"in film praha, titanic","Czech Republic, Slovakia",Slovak,Netflix,gypsy

You use it to cut stomachs open.” Dennis, who is even younger, is seen in a hysteric fit, mimicking some pornographic scene. Boys will be boys, but innocence is disproportionately spare here. Choosing not to dwell on the harsh specifics, Büttner reveals the disconcerting manner in which traumatic episodes can manifest themselves in the mundane — a game of Lego, Hide and Seek, or Truth or Dare. Filmed in lapidary black-and-white, Büttner’s fascinating film sheds light on childhood from the boys’ characteristically disadvantaged perspective — one not yet fully cognizant — leaving much ethically to ponder over.",0.6,/8DMaONyiIdgbkom6LC7uTwLYc83.jpg,Documentary,"büttner und stürmer, hochschule für gestaltung karlsruhe",Germany,German,Prime Video,kids
